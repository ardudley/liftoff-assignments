## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This project involves creating an educational test generator.  There will be student and teacher profiles where tests can be created and test scores saved.   Question types include multiple choice, true/false, and short answer.  Students can take tests and see their grades.  Teachers will be able to set a due date and see the class scores.
